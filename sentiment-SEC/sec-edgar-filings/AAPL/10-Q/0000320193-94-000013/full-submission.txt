             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results  have been included.  The results for  interim  periods
   are  not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire
   year.    These  financial  statements  and  notes  should  be  read   in
   conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial  statements
   and  the  notes  thereto for the fiscal year ended September  24,  1993,
   included  in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
   24, 1993 (the "1993 Form 10-K").

2. Effective September 25, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting  Standards No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes  (FAS  109),
   which  changes  the  method  of accounting for  income  taxes  from  the
   deferred  method  to  the liability method.  This change  in  accounting
   principle  has  been adopted on a prospective basis, and  the  financial
   statements  of  prior  years  have not been  restated.   The  cumulative
   effect of the change was not material.

   Under  FAS  109,  deferred income taxes reflect the  future  income  tax
   effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of  assets
   and  liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their  tax  bases.
   Prior  to  1994,  the  Company  accounted for  income  taxes  under  the
   provisions  of APB Opinion No. 11, which recognized deferred  taxes  for
   the  effect  of timing differences between pretax accounting income  and
   taxable income.

   At  September  25,  1993, the significant components  of  the  Company's
   deferred tax assets and liabilities were:

   U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $285
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested  in  operations  outside of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely invested earnings, the Company provides federal  and  state
   income   taxes   currently   on  undistributed   earnings   of   foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The   Internal   Revenue  Service  has  proposed  federal   income   tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and the Company  has  made
   prepayments   thereon.    The  Company  has  contested   these   alleged
   deficiencies  and  is  pursuing administrative  and  judicial  remedies.
   Management  believes  that adequate provision  has  been  made  for  any
   adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

   effective  yield  to  maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay  interest  semi-
   annually and mature on February 15, 2004.

4. In  the  third  quarter  of  1993,  the  Company  initiated  a  plan  to
   restructure   its  operations  worldwide  in  order   to   address   the
   competitive conditions in the personal computer industry, including  the
   increased  market demand for lower-priced products.  In connection  with
   this  plan,  the  Company recorded a $321 million  charge  to  operating
   expenses  ($199  million,  or  $1.72  per  share,  after  taxes).    The
   restructuring  costs included $162 million of estimated employee-related
   expenses and $159 million of estimated facilities, equipment, and  other
   expenses  associated  with  the  consolidation  of  operations  and  the
   relocation and termination of certain operations and employees.

   In  the  third quarter of 1994, the Company lowered its estimate of  the
   total   costs   associated  with  the  restructuring  and  recorded   an
   adjustment  which  increased income by $127  million  ($79  million,  or
   $0.66  per share, after taxes).  This adjustment primarily reflects  the
   modification  or  cancellation  of certain  elements  of  the  Company's
   original   restructure  plan  because  changing  business  and  economic
   conditions  have  made  certain  elements  of  the  Company's   original
   restructure   plan   financially   less   attractive   than   originally
   anticipated.  In addition, some actions were completed at a  lower  cost
   than  originally  estimated.  For further discussion,  see  "Results  of
   Operations - Restructuring Costs."

5. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options  outstanding  during the period.  Loss  per  share  is  computed
   using  the  weighted average number of common shares outstanding  during
   the period.

6. Certain  prior  year  amounts  on the consolidated  balance  sheets  and
   statements  of  cash  flows have been reclassified  to  conform  to  the
   current period presentation.

7. On  July  20,  1994, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend  of
   $0.12  per share for shareholders of record as of August 19, 1994, which
   will be distributed on September 9, 1994.

Net  sales  for  the third quarter and first nine months of 1994  increased
over   the   comparable  periods  of  1993.   Total  Macintosh  (registered
trademark)  computer unit sales increased 14% and 21% in the third  quarter
and first nine months of 1994, respectively, over the comparable periods of
1993. This unit sales growth resulted principally from strong sales of  the
Company's  new  Power  Macintosh (trademark) products first  introduced  on
March  14,  1994,  and  from newer product offerings  within  the  Performa
(registered  trademark)  family of desktop personal  computers  and,  to  a
lesser  extent,  within  the  PowerBook (registered  trademark)  family  of
notebook  personal  computers.  This unit growth was  partially  offset  by
declining  unit sales of certain of the Company's older product  offerings.
The  average  aggregate  revenue  per  Macintosh  computer  unit  increased
slightly  in the third quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of  1993,
primarily  as  a  result of a shift in unit sales from the Company's  entry
level   desktop  personal  computers  to  its  mid-range  desktop  personal
computers.   The  average  aggregate revenue per  Macintosh  computer  unit
declined 5% in the first nine months of 1994 over the comparable period  of
1993, primarily as a result of pricing actions undertaken by the Company in
response  to  continuing industrywide pricing pressures and  the  Company's
relatively high levels of inventory.

International net sales grew 17% in the third quarter and 19% in the  first
nine  months  of 1994 over the comparable periods of 1993.   The  increases
primarily  reflected  strong  net  sales  growth  in  the  Pacific  region,
particularly Japan.  Net sales for the third quarter and first nine  months
of 1994 grew slightly in Europe over the comparable periods of 1993 despite
generally  weak  economic conditions and competitive pressures  in  various
European  countries.  International net sales represented 47%  and  48%  of
total  net  sales  for  the third quarter and first nine  months  of  1994,
respectively, compared with 46% for both the third quarter and  first  nine
months  of 1993.  Domestic net sales grew 14% in the third quarter and  11%
in the first nine months of 1994 over the comparable periods of 1993.

In  general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an  as-
needed  basis due to the Company's distribution strategy, which is designed
to  expedite  the filling of orders.  Resellers frequently change  delivery
schedules   and  order  rates  depending  on  changing  market  conditions.
Unfilled  orders ("backlog") can be, and often are, canceled at will.   The
Company's  backlog  increased to approximately $767 million  at  August  5,
1994,  from approximately $496 million at April 29, 1994, primarily due  to
new  product  introductions  which  occurred  during  the  Company's  third
quarter.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time  is  not a meaningful indication of  its  future  business
prospects.   In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  of  or
immediately  following introduction of new products, such as  the  recently
introduced  Power  Macintosh and PowerBook 500 series of notebook  personal
computers,  because  of  over-ordering by dealers  anticipating  shortages.
Backlog  often is reduced sharply once dealers and customers  believe  they
can  obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, as well  as  other
factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a
reliable   indicator   of  the  Company's  future  revenue   or   financial
performance.   See  "Factors That May Affect Future Operating  Results  and
Financial Condition" below.

Gross Margin

Gross  margin  declined  both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during the third quarter and first nine months of 1994, respectively,  over
the comparable periods of 1993. The decline in gross margin as a percentage
of  net  sales  was  primarily a result of pricing and promotional  actions
undertaken  by  the  Company in response to industrywide pricing  pressures
(including   the   increasing  price  competition  that  the   Company   is
experiencing  in  the  Japanese  market)  and  relatively  high  levels  of
inventory.   Gross  margin was also adversely affected by  increased  costs
associated   with   providing  customers  a  wider   variety   of   product
configuration options.

Gross  margin  was also affected somewhat adversely by changes  in  foreign
currency  exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative  to
certain  foreign  currencies during both the first and second  quarters  of
1994,  compared with the corresponding periods of 1993.  Gross  margin  was
relatively unaffected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  during
the  third quarter of 1994, compared with the corresponding period of 1993.
The  Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes  in
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations  can
be  significantly  affected in the short term by  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency exchange rates.

Although gross margin increased from 24.0% in the second quarter of 1994 to
26.7%  in  the third quarter of 1994, primarily due to increased  sales  of
Power  Macintosh  products coupled with strong early  demand  for  the  new
PowerBook   500  series  of  notebook  personal  computers,   the   Company
anticipates  that gross margins will remain under pressure and below  prior
years'  levels  worldwide due to a variety of factors, including  continued
industrywide  pricing  pressures,  increased  competition  and   compressed
product life cycles.

Research  and development expenditures decreased both in amount  and  as  a
percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 1994,
compared  with  the corresponding periods of 1993.  This decrease  reflects
the results of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing costs,
including product development expenditures.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and development
are  critical  to  its  future  growth  and  competitive  position  in  the
marketplace  and are directly related to continued, timely  development  of
new  and  enhanced  products.  The Company anticipates  that  research  and
development  expenditures will decrease slightly as  a  percentage  of  net
sales during the remainder of 1994, as the Company maintains its efforts to
manage operating expense levels  relative to gross margin levels.

Selling,  general and administrative expenses decreased both in amount  and
as  a percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of
1994,  compared with the corresponding periods of 1993.  This decrease  was
primarily attributable to the Company's restructuring actions initiated  in
the third quarter of 1993, which resulted in a decrease in employee-related
expenses.  Lower selling expenses also contributed to the decrease  as  the
Company  continued its efforts to manage operating expense levels  relative
to gross margin levels.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and administrative expense levels relative to gross margin levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross margins, and continued weak economic conditions worldwide.

In  the  third quarter of 1993, the Company initiated a plan to restructure
its operations worldwide in order to address the competitive conditions  in
the  personal computer industry, including the increased market demand  for
lower-priced products.  In connection with this plan, the Company  recorded
a  $321  million charge to operating expenses ($199 million, or  $1.72  per
share,  after  taxes).  The restructuring costs included  $162  million  of
estimated   employee-related  expenses  and  $159  million   of   estimated
facilities, equipment, and other expenses associated with the consolidation
of  operations and the relocation and termination of certain operations and
employees.

In the third quarter of 1994, the Company lowered its estimate of the total
costs  associated  with the restructuring and recorded an adjustment  which
increased  income by $127 million ($79 million, or $0.66 per  share,  after
taxes).    This   adjustment  primarily  reflects   the   modification   or
cancellation of certain elements of the Company's original restructure plan
because  changing  business  and  economic  conditions  have  made  certain
elements  of  the  Company's  original restructure  plan  financially  less
attractive  than  originally anticipated.  In addition, some  actions  were
completed at a lower cost than originally estimated.

The  most  significant  element of the adjustment is  associated  with  $61
million  in  costs  accrued  to move a number of  employees  from  the  San
Francisco  Bay  Area to a lower cost location.  This part of the  Company's
original  restructure  plan was expected to result in  the  termination  or
relocation  of  approximately 2,000 employees and the  closure  of  certain
leased  facilities, at a cost of $39 million and $22 million  respectively.
The  expected  benefits  of this move have been reduced  since  the  plan's
inception because of changes to the cost differential between the Company's
current  and  alternative locations.  For example,  the  Company  favorably
renegotiated the lease terms of certain facilities in its current location,
the  salary  growth rate differentials between the Bay Area and alternative
locations have been reduced and recent changes to the California income tax
code  make  it more attractive for companies to do business in  California.
The Company canceled this action in the current quarter

                                       10
<PAGE>

when  management  decided that the extended estimated  pay-back  period  no
longer justified the initial cash investment and the unquantifiable cost of
business disruption that such a move would precipitate.

The  Company  continues to search for ways to permanently reduce  its  cost
structure;  however, the Company has achieved a lower  level  of  operating
expenses  without  fully implementing all of the restructuring  actions  as
originally   planned.    For   example,   operating   expenses   (excluding
restructure) in the third quarter of fiscal 1994 have been reduced by  $124
million from the same quarter a year ago.

As  of  July  1, 1994, the Company had $75 million of accrued restructuring
costs  for actions that are currently underway and expected to be completed
within one year.  Of this remaining $75 million reserve, approximately  $70
million represents cash charges, the majority of which are expected  to  be
incurred  within one year.  Spending beyond one year primarily  relates  to
approximately   $6  million  of  recurring  payments  under   noncancelable
operating  leases,  which  will  extend  beyond  the  initiation   of   the
restructure action.

Interest  and  other  income  (expense), net, decreased  during  the  third
quarter  of  1994, compared with the corresponding period  of  1993.   Nine
million  dollars  of  this decline reflected gains of six  million  dollars
related  to the Company's ongoing hedging activities recorded in the  third
quarter of 1993, compared with losses of   three million dollars related to
the  same  activities, recorded in the third quarter of 1994.  In  general,
gains  and  losses on foreign exchange activity recorded  to  interest  and
other income (expense), net, relate to  transaction exposure hedging   and
include the mark-to-market results of all foreign exchange contracts  that
are  not eligible for hedge accounting treatment.  Also attributable to the
decline, was an increase in interest expense of  six million dollars due to
higher  interest rates and larger borrowing balances used to  fund  working
capital  needs.   The  Company's  interest  rate  hedging  strategies   are
generally  designed  to  better match the Company's floating-rate  interest
earnings on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with the fixed-
rate  interest expense on its long-term debt.  In line with this  strategy,
the  Company  entered  into  derivative interest  rate  transactions  on  a
majority  of  its long-term debt, swapping its fixed-rate obligation  to  a
floating-rate obligation.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, decreased  in  the  first  nine
months  of  1994,  compared with the corresponding period  of  1993.   This
decrease primarily reflected the following non-recurring transactions which
occurred in the first nine months of 1993: interest earned on an income tax
refund  from the Internal Revenue Service and a gain on the sale of certain
of  the  Company's venture capital investments.  Also contributing to  this
decrease was an increase in interest expense in 1994 due to higher interest
rates  and  larger borrowing balances used to fund working  capital  needs.
This decrease was offset in part by certain financing expenses recorded  in
1993 that did not recur in 1994.

Factors That May Affect Future Operating Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture and
market  technologically  innovative  products  in  order  to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future operating results and financial condition.

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance, the Company's
ability  to  manage  the  risks associated with  product  transitions,  the
effective  management of inventory levels in line with anticipated  product
demand, and the manufacturing of products in appropriate quantities to meet
anticipated demand.  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate
effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.

On  March 14, 1994, the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new  line  of
Macintosh  computers based on a new PowerPC family of RISC microprocessors.
The  Company's  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  may  be
adversely  affected if it is unable to successfully complete the transition
of  its  line of Macintosh personal computers and servers from the Motorola
68000 series of microprocessors to the PowerPC microprocessor.  The success
of this ongoing transition will depend on the Company's ability to continue
to  sell  products  based on the Motorola 68000 series  of  microprocessors
while  gaining  market  acceptance of the new  PowerPC-based  products,  to
successfully  manage inventory levels of both product lines simultaneously,
and  to  coordinate the timely development and distribution of new "native"
versions of commonly-used software products specifically designed  for  the
PowerPC-based  products  by  independent software  vendors.   For  example,
potential  users may defer a decision to purchase Power Macintosh  products
until  certain  productivity applications (such  as  Microsoft  (registered
trademark)  Excel  (registered trademark) and Word (registered  trademark))
are available as native software products for Power Macintosh.

The  rate of product shipment immediately following introduction of  a  new
product is not necessarily an indication of the anticipated future rate  of
shipments  for that product, which depends on many factors, some  of  which
are  not  under  the  control of the Company.  These factors  may  include:
initial  large  purchases by a small segment of the user  population  which
tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of
users  (early adopters); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by
persons  who anticipated new technology and as a result deferred  purchases
of  other  products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate  shortages
due  to  the aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be  offset  by
other  factors, such as: the deferral of purchases by many users until  new
technology  is  accepted as "proven" and for which commonly  used  software
products  are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers  once  they
believe they can obtain sufficient supply of previously backlogged product.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability of  European  language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial demand for new products in geographic areas outside  of  the
United  States, although localized versions of the Company's  new  products
may be available.

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the  above
demand factors, often increasing sharply coincident with introduction,  and
then  reducing sharply once dealers and customers believe they  can  obtain
sufficient supply.

Competition

The  personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues  to  be
characterized  by  consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,
aggressive pricing practices, and downward pressure on gross margins.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected  should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact  on
the  Company of industrywide pricing pressures and continue to realize  the
anticipated cost-reduction benefits associated with its restructuring  plan
initiated in the third quarter of 1993.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected   by    the  Company's  ability  to  offer  customers  competitive
technologies while effectively managing the impact on inventory levels  and
the potential for customer confusion created by product proliferation.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by  the Company's ability to implement and manage the competitive
risk associated with certain of the Company's collaboration agreements with
other  companies,  such  as  the  agreements  with  International  Business
Machines Corporation (IBM).

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected by  the Company's ability to increase market share in its personal
computer  business.  The Company is currently the only  maker  of  hardware
which uses the Macintosh operating system; however, the Company has only  a
minority  market share in the personal computer market, which is  dominated
by  makers  of  computers  which  run the MS-DOS(registered trademark)  and
Microsoft  Windows(trademark) operating  systems.   Although certain of 
the Company's  personal  computer products are capable of running software
designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating  systems,  they  do so by 
means of software  emulation  of  Intel microprocessor chips (except for 
one product, which does so by means  of  a co-processor card).  However, 
optimal performance of the Company's products is  obtained  by  use of 
software specifically designed for  the  Company's products,   either   
those   based  on  the  Motorola   68000   series   of microprocessors 
or those based on the PowerPC microprocessor.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed  to  a  MS-DOS  or Windows-based system, are  often  based  on  the
availability  of  third-party  software for particular  applications.   The
Company  believes that the availability of third-party application software
for  the  Company's  hardware products depends in part on  the  third-party
developer's perception and analysis of the relative benefits of  developing
such  software  for  the Company's products as opposed to  the  larger  MS-
DOS/Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors such as the relative
market  share of the Company's products, the anticipated potential  revenue
which  may be earned, and the associated costs of developing such  software
products.

Microsoft  Corporation is the developer of MS-DOS and the Windows operating
systems,  which  are  the  principal competing  operating  systems  to  the
Company's  Macintosh  operating system.  Microsoft  is  also  an  important
developer of application software for the Company's products.  Accordingly,
Microsoft's  interest in producing application software for  the  Company's
products  may  be  influenced by its perception  of  its  interests  as  an
operating system vendor.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
new  PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors which produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessor used by most personal computers using the MS-DOS and Windows
operating  systems.   IBM produces personal computers based  on  the  Intel
microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is  also  the
developer  of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Macintosh
operating  system.   Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying  the  Company
with improved versions of microprocessors for the Company's products may be
influenced  by its perception of its interests as a competing  manufacturer
of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.



                                       13
<PAGE>

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by   the  Company's   ability  to  successfully  expand  its  new
businesses  and  product offerings into other markets  such  as  broadening
industry  acceptance of the Newton (trademark) personal  digital  assistant
(PDA)  products and effectively licensing Newton technology  and  marketing
the related products and services.

Global and General Economic Conditions

A large portion of the Company's revenues in recent years has come from its
international operations.  As a result, the Company's operating results and
financial condition could be significantly affected by international
factors,  such  as  changes  in foreign currency  exchange  rates  or  weak
economic conditions in foreign markets in which the Company distributes its
products.   The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into  account
changes  in  exchange  rates over time; however, the Company's  results  of
operations  can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

Inventory

The  Company's products include certain components, such as specific 
microprocessors manufactured by Motorola Inc. and  monochrome active-matrix   
displays manufactured by Hosiden Corporation, that are currently available 
only from single sources. Any availability limitations, interruptions in 
supplies, or price increases of these and other components could adversely 
affect the Company's  business and financial results.  The Company's future
operating results  and  financial condition may also be adversely  affected
by the Company's ability to manage inventory levels and lead times required 
to obtain components in order to be more responsive to short-term shifts in
customer  demand patterns.  In addition, if anticipated unit  sales  growth
for  new and current product offerings is not realized, inventory valuation
reserves  may  be  necessary  which could adversely  impact  the  Company's
results of operations and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution of
the  Company's  products.   Currently,  the  Company's  primary  means   of
distribution  is  through  third-party  computer  resellers.   However,  in
response  to  changing  industry practices and  customer  preferences,  the
Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels such  as
mass-merchandise stores (such as Sears and Wal-Mart), consumer  electronics
outlets,  and  computer superstores.  The Company's business and  financial
results  could  be adversely affected if the financial condition  of  these
sellers weakens or if sellers within consumer channels decide not to 
continue to distribute the Company's products.

Other

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

The Company plans to replace its current transaction systems (which include
order  management, distribution, manufacturing and finance) with  a  single
integrated  system  as  part of its ongoing effort to increase  operational
efficiency.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition
could  be  adversely affected by its ability to implement  and  effectively
manage the transition to this new integrated system.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments,  net of short-term borrowings  increased  to  $713
million  at  July 1, 1994, from $69 million at September  24,  1993.   This
increase  includes  $300  million in long-term debt  proceeds  due  to  the
implementation  of long-term financing arrangements which  replaced  short-
term  financing.   This  increase was also attributable  to  the  Company's
continued  efforts to improve profit levels and to manage working  capital,
particularly in the area of inventory management.

Cash  generated by operations during the first nine months of 1994  totaled
$495  million.  Cash was generated primarily by the decrease  in  inventory
levels  which  resulted from improved inventory management,  improved  1994
sales  levels attributable to various pricing and promotional actions,  and
sales  of  inventory  which  had  been built  up  in  preparation  for  the
introduction  of  Power Macintosh products.  Increased sales  and  improved
profit  levels also contributed to cash generated by operations during  the
first  nine  months of 1994. Accounts receivable decreased over  the  nine-
month period, reflecting improved cash collection activity.

Cash  generated  by  operations  was partially  offset  by  cash  used  for
restructuring  of $106 million, as the restructuring actions  initiated  in
the third quarter of 1993 continued to be implemented.  In addition, in the
third  quarter  of  1994, the Company lowered its  estimate  of  the  costs
associated  with  the  restructuring  and  recorded  an  adjustment   which
increased  income by $127 million ($79 million, or $0.66 per  share,  after
taxes).    This   adjustment  primarily  reflects   the   modification   or
cancellation  of  certain elements of the Company's original  restructuring
plan  because  changing business and economic conditions have made  certain
elements  of  the  Company's  original restructure  plan  financially  less
attractive than originally anticipated.

Cash  used  for  the  purchase  of property, plant  and  equipment  totaled
approximately  $123 million during the first nine months  of  1994.   These
purchases were primarily for land, buildings, machinery and equipment.  The
Company  anticipates  that capital expenditures in 1994  will  be  slightly
below 1993 expenditures of $213 million.

In  January  1994, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company  exercised  its
option to purchase for $51.9 million the remaining partnership interest  in
the  Cupertino  Gateway Partners partnership, a general partnership,  which
owned  the  Company's campus-type office facilities located  in  Cupertino,
California  (the  "Campus").  As a result of this purchase,  the  Company's
wholly-owned subsidiary now owns 100% of the right, title and  interest  in
the  Campus.  The $51.9 million payment is included in the $123 million  of
property,  plant and equipment purchased during the first  nine  months  of
1994.

The  Company's aggregate short- and long-term borrowings at July  1,  1994,
were approximately $821 million, comprised of approximately $516 million in
short-term   borrowings  and  approximately  $305  million   in   long-term
borrowings.  Aggregate borrowings at September 24, 1993 were $830 million.

                                       15
<PAGE>

The  balance  of long-term debt increased during the first nine  months  of
1994,  due  to the issuance of $300 million aggregate principal  amount  of
6.5%  unsecured  notes under an omnibus shelf registration statement  filed
with  the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This shelf registration  was
for the registration of debt and other securities  for  an aggregate 
offering amount of $500 million.   The  notes were  sold at 99.925% of par, 
for an effective yield to maturity of  6.51%.  The notes pay interest 
semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.

Short-term  borrowings  at  July 1, 1994, were approximately  $308  million
lower than at September 24, 1993, as the proceeds from the issuance of $300
million  in  long-term debt were used to pay down the balance of short-term
borrowings.  The Company's short-term borrowings are principally under  its
commercial  paper program.  From time to time, the Company also borrows  to
finance operations pursuant to short-term uncommitted bid-line arrangements
with  commercial  banks.  During the first quarter  of  1994,  the  Company
entered  into  a  $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility  with  a
syndicate  of banks to support its commercial paper program.  No borrowings
have  been  made under this facility.  In addition, during the  first  nine
months  of  1994,  Apple  Japan,  Inc., a wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the
Company,  incurred  short-term  yen-denominated  borrowings  from   several
Japanese  banks, the balance of which aggregated the U.S. dollar equivalent
of approximately $260  million at July 1, 1994.

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short-  and  long-term
borrowings  from  time to time to finance U.S. working  capital  needs  and
capital expenditures, because substantially all of the Company's cash, cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments are held by foreign  subsidiaries,
generally  in  U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held  by  foreign
subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation  to
the United States; the Company's financial statements fully provide for any
related  tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated.  See Note  2  of
the  "Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)" in  Part  I,
Item 1 for further discussion.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984 through 1988, which the Company is  contesting.   The
Company believes the resolution of any tax liability for these proposed tax
deficiencies  will  occur  over  the course  of  the  next  several  years.
Although  payment of any assessment is not required until the end  of  such
process,  the  Company elected to make a prepayment in April 1991  for  the
years  1984  through 1986, and a prepayment in May 1993 for the years  1987
through 1988.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference  is made to pages 34 through 36 of the Company's 1993  Form  10-K
under  the  heading  "Litigation", for a discussion of  certain  litigation
involving   Microsoft   Corporation  and  Hewlett-Packard   Company;   1993
Securities  and  Derivative Litigation; litigation  involving  a  complaint
filed  by  Jerome Lemelson; and litigation involving a complaint  filed  by
Richard B. Grant.

On  July  11,  1994  there were oral arguments in Apple Computer,  Inc.  v.
Microsoft  Corporation & Hewlett-Packard Company before the  Ninth  Circuit
Court  of  Appeals relating to the appeal by Apple from the final  judgment
entered in the District Court.  The Court of Appeals has not yet issued its
decision.

Lemelson  v.  Apple  Computer, Inc. is scheduled to go  to  jury  trial  in
January, 1995.  Mr. Lemelson has not specified damages claimed in that case
but  has  requested  injunctive relief.  Grant v. Apple Computer,  Inc.  is
scheduled  to go to jury trial in October, 1994.  Mr. Grant claims  damages
up to $729 million dollars, has requested these damages be trebled, and has
requested injunctive relief.

The  Company continues to believe the suits cited above to be without merit
and  intends  to  vigorously  defend against these  actions.   The  Company
believes  resolution of all these matters will not have a material  adverse
effect on its financial condition and results of operations as reported  in
the accompanying financial statements.

BY-LAWS
OF
APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
(a California corporation)

(as amended through April 20, 1994)

Article I

OFFICES

      Section 1.1:   Principal Office.  The principal executive office  for
the  transaction of the business of this corporation shall  be  1  Infinite
Loop,  Cupertino,  California  95014.  The Board  of  Directors  is  hereby
granted  full  power and authority to change the location of the  principal
executive office from one location to another.

     Section 1.2:   Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate
offices  may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors  at
such  place or places within or without the State of California as it deems
appropriate.


Article II

DIRECTORS

      Section  2.1:    Exercise of Corporate Powers.  Except  as  otherwise
provided  by  these  By-Laws,  by the Articles  of  Incorporation  of  this
corporation  or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter  in
force,  the  business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed  and
all  corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction  of  the
Board of Directors.

      Section  2.2:    Number.  The number of directors of the  corporation
shall  be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact  number
of  directors shall be eight (8) until changed within the limits  specified
above,  by  a  by-law amending this section, duly adopted by the  Board  of
Directors  or by the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors  may
be changed, or a definite number fixed without provision for an
indefinite  number,  by  a  duly  adopted  amendment  to  the  Articles  of
Incorporation or by an amendment to this by-law duly adopted by the vote or
written consent of holders of a majority of the


                                       20
<PAGE>
outstanding  shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an  amendment
reducing  the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to  a  number
less than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption
at  a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case
of  action  by  written  consent, are equal to more  than  16-2/3%  of  the
outstanding  shares entitled to vote.  No amendment may change  the  stated
maximum  number of authorized directors to a number greater than two  times
the stated minimum number of directors minus one.

      Section  2.3:    Need  Not Be Shareholders.  The  directors  of  this
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.

      Section 2.4:   Compensation.  Directors and members of committees may
receive  such compensation, if any, for their services as may be  fixed  or
determined  by  resolution  of  the Board  of  Directors.   Nothing  herein
contained  shall  be construed to preclude any director from  serving  this
corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

      Section  2.5:   Election and Term of Office.  The directors shall  be
divided  into  two classes, designated Class I and Class  II.   Each  class
shall consist of one-half of the directors or as close an approximation  as
possible.   The  initial term of office of the directors of Class  I  shall
expire  at  the annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991  and  the
initial  term  of office of the directors of Class II shall expire  at  the
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1992.  At each annual meeting,
commencing with the annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991, each
of  the  successors  to the directors of the class whose  term  shall  have
expired  at  such annual meeting shall be elected for a term running  until
the second annual meeting next succeeding his or her election and until his
or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

      Section  2.6:   Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on  the  Board  of
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal  of  any
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if  the
shareholders  fail,  at  any annual meeting of shareholders  at  which  any
director is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be
voted  for at that meeting.  The Board of Directors may declare vacant  the
office  of a director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an  order
of court or convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after notice of his
or her election, he or she does not accept the office.  Any vacancy, except
for  a vacancy created by removal of a director as provided in Section  2.7
hereof,  may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the  remaining
directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by  a  sole
remaining  director.   Vacancies occurring in the  Board  of  Directors  by
reason of
removal of directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders.  The
shareholders  may  elect a director at any time to  fill  any  vacancy  not
filled by the directors.  Any such election by written consent requires the
consent  of  a  majority of the outstanding shares entitled to  vote.   If,
after  the filling of any vacancy by the directors, the directors  then  in
office who have been elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than
a  majority  of the directors then in office, any holder or holders  of  an
aggregate  of  5%  or  more  of the total number  of  shares  at  the  time
outstanding having the right to vote for such directors may call a  special
meeting of shareholders to be held to elect the entire

                                       21
<PAGE>
Board  of  Directors.  The term of office of any director  shall  terminate
upon  such election of a successor.  Any director may resign effective upon
giving  written  notice to the Chairman of the Board,  if  any,  the  Chief
Executive  Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of  Directors
of  this  corporation, unless the notice specifies a  later  time  for  the
effectiveness  of such resignation.  If the resignation is effective  at  a
future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation
becomes effective.  A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall
not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director's term  of
office.

      Section  2.7:    Removal.  The  entire  Board  of  Directors  or  any
individual  director  may  be  removed without  cause  from  office  by  an
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to  vote;
provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director
shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting  in
writing  to  such  removal, would be sufficient to elect such  director  if
voted  cumulatively  (without regard to whether such shares  may  be  voted
cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of  votes  were
cast,  or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares  entitled
to  vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most
recent  annual  meeting  of  shareholders, or if  greater,  the  number  of
directors  for whom removal is being sought, were then being  elected.   If
any  or  all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at  the
same  meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or  series
of  shares  is  entitled  to  elect one or more directors  under  authority
granted  by  the  Articles  of  Incorporation  of  this  corporation,   the
provisions  of  this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that  class  or
series and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

      Section 2.8:   Powers and Duties.  Without limiting the generality or
extent  of  the general corporate powers to be exercised by  the  Board  of
Directors  pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby  provided
that  the  Board  of Directors shall have full power with  respect  to  the
following matters:

           (a)   To  purchase,  lease, and acquire any  and  all  kinds  of

by  whom  any  or  all  of the checks, drafts, notes,  bills  of  exchange,
contracts and other corporate instruments shall be executed.

           (g)  To accept resignations of directors; to declare vacant  the
office  of  a director as provided in Section 2.6 hereof; and, in  case  of
vacancy in the office of directors, to fill the same to the extent provided
in Section 2.6 hereof.

faithful service.

           (i)  To designate some person to perform the duties and exercise
the  powers of any officer of this corporation during the temporary absence
or disability of such officer.

           (j)   To appoint or employ and to remove at pleasure such agents
and  employees  as  it may see fit, to prescribe their titles,  powers  and
duties,  limit their authority, and fix their salaries in any  way  it  may
deem  advisable which is not contrary to law or these By-Laws; and,  if  it
sees  fit,  to  require  from  them or any of them  security  for  faithful
performance.

          (k)  To fix a time in the future, which shall not be more than 60
days  nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the meeting nor more  than
sixty  (60)  days prior to any other action for which it  is  fixed,  as  a
record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of
and  to  vote  at  any meeting, or entitled to receive any payment  of  any
dividend or other distribution, or allotment of any rights, or entitled  to
exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action; and in such case
only  shareholders  of  record on the date so fixed shall  be  entitled  to
notice  of  and  to  vote  at  the meeting  or  to  receive  the  dividend,
distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise the rights, as the  case
may  be,  notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books  of  this
corporation  after  any  record date fixed  as  aforesaid.   The  Board  of
Directors  may  close  the books of this corporation against  transfers  of
shares during the whole or any part of such period.

          (l)  To fix and locate from time to time the principal office for
the  transaction of the business of this corporation and one or more branch
or  other  subordinate  office or offices of  this  corporation  within  or
without  the State of California; to designate any place within or  without

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

      Section 10.1:  Place of Meetings.  Meetings (whether regular, special
or  adjourned) of the shareholders of this corporation shall be held at the
principal  executive  office  for  the  transaction  of  business  of  this
corporation,  or  at  any place within or without the State  which  may  be
designated  by  written consent of all the shareholders  entitled  to  vote
thereat,  or  which  may  be  designated by  resolution  of  the  Board  of
Directors.  Any meeting shall be valid wherever held if held by the written
consent  of  all  the shareholders entitled to vote thereat,  given  either
before  or  after  the  meeting  and  filed  with  the  Secretary  of  this
corporation.

       Section  10.2:   Annual  Meetings.   The  annual  meeting   of   the
shareholders shall be held at the hour of 10:00 a.m. on the last  Wednesday
in  January in each year , if not a legal holiday, and if a legal  holiday,
then  on  the next succeeding business day not a legal holiday or  at  such
other time in a particular year as may be designated by written consent  of
all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat or which may be designated by
resolution of the Board of Directors.  Such annual meetings shall  be  held
at  the  place  provided  pursuant to Section  10.1  hereof.   Said  annual
meetings  shall  be held for the purpose of the election of directors,  for
the  making  of  reports  of the affairs of this corporation  and  for  the
transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting.

     Section 10.3:  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders
for  any  purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time  by  the
President or by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members  thereof,
or  by  one  or more holders of shares entitled to cast not less  than  ten
percent (10%) of the votes at the meeting.  Upon request in writing sent by
registered  mail to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice  President
or  Secretary,  or delivered to any such officer in person, by  any  person
entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders, it shall be the duty of
such  officer  forthwith to cause notice to be given  to  the  shareholders
entitled to vote that a meeting will be requested by the person or  persons
calling the meeting, which shall be not less than 35 days nor more than  60
days after the receipt of such request.

Section  10.4:  Notice of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting of  shareholders
shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
date  of  the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat  by  the
Secretary  or  an  Assistant Secretary, or other person charged  with  that
duty,  or if there be no such officer or person, or in case of his  or  her
neglect or refusal, by any director or shareholder.  The notice shall state
the  place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of  a  special
meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no  other
business  may  be  transacted, or (ii) in the case of the  annual  meeting,
those  matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing  of
the  notice,  intends  to present for action by the shareholders,  but  any
proper matter may be

                                       31

<PAGE>
presented at the meeting for such action except that notice must  be  given
or  waived  in  writing of any proposal relating to approval  of  contracts
between the corporation and any director of this corporation, amendment  of
the  Articles  of  Incorporation, reorganization  of  this  corporation  or
winding  up  of  this  corporation.  The notice of  any  meeting  at  which
directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees intended at
the time of the notice to be presented by management for election.  Written
notice  shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder,  either  (i)
personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, charges
prepaid,  addressed  to  such  shareholder at  such  shareholder's  address
appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder  to
this  corporation  for  the purpose of notice.  If a shareholder  gives  no
address or no such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice
shall  be  deemed  to have been given if sent by mail  or  other  means  of
written  communication addressed to the place where the principal executive
office of this corporation is located, or if published at least once  in  a
newspaper  of  general circulation in the county in which  such  office  is
located.   The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the  time  when
delivered  personally  or  deposited in the  United  States  mail,  postage
prepaid,  or sent by other means of written communication and addressed  as
hereinbefore provided.  An affidavit of delivery or mailing of  any  notice
in  accordance  with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed  by  the
Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima  facie
evidence  of  the  giving of the notice.  If any notice  addressed  to  the
shareholder  at the address of such shareholder appearing on the  books  of
the corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal
Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is  unable
to  deliver  the  notice  to the shareholder at such  address,  all  future
notices shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing  if
the  same shall be available for the shareholder upon written demand of the
shareholder  at  the principal executive office of this corporation  for  a
period  of one year from the date of the giving of the notice to all  other
shareholders.

     Section 10.5:  Consent to Shareholders' Meetings.  The transactions of
any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held,
are  as  valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call  and
notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either
before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not
present  in  person  or by proxy, signs a written waiver  of  notice  or  a
consent  to  the  holding  of such meeting or an approval  of  the  minutes
thereof.   All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with  the
corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.  Attendance
of  a  person  at  a meeting shall constitute a waiver of  notice  of  such
meeting,  except when the person objects, at the beginning of the  meeting,
to  the  transaction of any business because the meeting  is  not  lawfully
called  or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver
of  any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law  to
be  included  in  the  notice but not so included,  if  such  objection  is
expressly  made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be  transacted  at
nor  the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need  be
specified  in  any  written  waiver of notice, except  as  to  approval  of
contracts  between this corporation and any of its directors, amendment  of
the  Articles  of  Incorporation, reorganization  of  this  corporation  or
winding up the affairs of this corporation.

<PAGE>
      Section  10.6:  Quorum.  The presence in person or by  proxy  of  the
holders  of  a  majority of the shares entitled to vote at any  meeting  of
shareholders  shall  constitute a quorum for the transaction  of  business.
Shares shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting  of
such  shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot
be  lawfully  voted  at the meeting.  The shareholders present  at  a  duly
called  or  held  meeting  at which a quorum is  present  may  continue  to
transact  business  until  adjournment notwithstanding  the  withdrawal  of
enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other
than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required
to constitute a quorum.

     Section 10.7:  Adjourned Meetings.  Any shareholders' meeting, whether
or  not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote
of  a  majority of the shares, the holders of which are either  present  in
person  or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section
10.6  hereof,  in  the  absence  of a quorum,  no  other  business  may  be
transacted at such meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more  than  45
days  or  if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting,  a  notice  of  the  adjourned meeting  shall  be  given  to  each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting.  Except as  aforesaid,
it  shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of  the
adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat other than by
announcement  at the meeting at which such adjournment is  taken.   At  any
adjourned  meeting the shareholders may transact any business  which  might
have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section  10.8:  Voting Rights.  Only persons in whose names shares entitled
to  vote  stand on the stock records of this corporation at  the  close  of
business  on  the  business day next preceding the day on which  notice  is
given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day
next  preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other  day
be  fixed  for  the  determination of shareholders of  record  pursuant  to
Section 2.8(j) hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at
such  meeting.   The record date for determining shareholders  entitled  to
give  consent  to  corporate action in writing without a meeting,  when  no
prior action by the Board of Directors has been taken, shall be the day  on
which  the first written consent is given.  In the absence of any  contrary
provision  in  the  Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable  statute
relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters,  each
such person shall be entitled to one vote for each share.

      Section 10.9:  Action by Written Consents.  Any action which  may  be
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without
a  meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth
the  action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding  shares
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled  to
vote  thereon  were  present  and  voted.   Unless  the  consents  of   all
shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, notice of any
shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this corporation and  any  of
its directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, (iii) reorganization  of
this corporation or (iv) distributions to


                                       33
<PAGE>
shareholders  upon winding up of this corporation in certain  circumstances
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given  at
least  10  days  before the consummation of the action authorized  by  such
approval,  and  prompt notice shall be given of the  taking  of  any  other
corporate  action approved by shareholders without a meeting by  less  than
unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who  have
not consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder shall conform to the
requirements  of  Section  10.4 hereto and applicable  law.   When  written
consents are given with respect to any shares, they shall be given  by  and
accepted from the persons in whose names such shares stand on the books  of
this  corporation at the time such respective consents are  given,  or  any
shareholder's  proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares  or  a  personal
representative  of the shareholder or their respective proxy  holders,  may
revoke  the consent by a writing received by this corporation prior to  the
time  that  written consents of the number of shares required to  authorize
the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary of this corporation,
but  may  not  do  so  thereafter.  Such revocation is effective  upon  its
receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.  Notwithstanding anything  to
the  contrary,  directors may not be elected by written consent  except  by
unanimous  written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the  election
of directors.

      Section  10.10: Elections of Directors. In any election of directors,
the  candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative  votes  of  the
shares  entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors  to  be
elected  by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and  votes
withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no  legal
effect.   Elections of directors need not be by ballot except  upon  demand
made by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.

      Section  10.11:  Proxies.  Every person entitled to vote  or  execute
consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one  or  more
agents  authorized  by  a written proxy executed by  such  person  or  such
person's  duly  authorized  agent and filed  with  the  Secretary  of  this
corporation.  No proxy shall be valid (l) after revocation thereof,  unless
the  proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to  this
Section  10.11  and applicable law, or (2) after the expiration  of  eleven
months  from  the  date thereof, unless the person executing  it  specifies
therein  the length of time for which such proxy is to continue  in  force.
Revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of  this
corporation  stating  that the proxy is revoked or by  a  subsequent  proxy
executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person  by,  the
person  executing  the  proxy.  A proxy is not  revoked  by  the  death  or
incapacity  of  the  maker unless, before the vote is  counted,  a  written
notice  of  such  death or incapacity is received by this  corporation.   A
proxy  which  states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for  the  period
specified  therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee  of
any  of  the  following: (l) a pledgee, (2) a person who has  purchased  or
agreed  to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or  a  person
who  has sold a portion of such person's shares in this corporation to  the
maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor or creditors of this corporation or  the
shareholder  who  extended or continued credit to this corporation  or  the
shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that  it  was
given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and  the
name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (4) a person who has
contracted  to  perform services as an employee of this corporation,  if  a
proxy is required by the contract of

                                       34

<PAGE>
employment  and  if the proxy states that it was given in consideration  of
such  contract  of employment, the name of the employee and the  period  of
employment  contracted for, (5) a person designated by  or  under  a  close
corporation  shareholder  agreement  or  a  voting  trust  agreement.    In
addition,  a  proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given  to  secure  the
performance  of  a duty or to protect a title, either legal  or  equitable,
until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation
secured by it.  Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the
proxy  becomes  revocable  when  the pledge  is  redeemed,  the  option  or
agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares
of  this  corporation  or  dies,  the  debt  of  this  corporation  or  the
shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the  contract
of employment has terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement
or  the voting trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may  be
revoked,  notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser
of  shares  without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless  the
existence  of  the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the  certificate
representing  such shares.  Every form of proxy or written  consent,  which
provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect  to
any  proposal,  shall also contain an appropriate space  marked  "abstain",
whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting  his  or
her  shares  on the proposal.  A proxy marked "abstain" by the  shareholder
with  respect  to a particular proposal shall not be voted  either  for  or
against such proposal.  In any election of directors, any form of proxy  in
which  the  directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates  and
which is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner
indicating  that  the authority to vote for the election  of  directors  is
withheld  shall  not  be  voted either for or against  the  election  of  a
director.

      Section  10.12:  Inspectors  of  Election.   Before  any  meeting  of
shareholders,  the  Board of Directors may appoint any persons  other  than
nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or  its
adjournment.   If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the  Chairman
of  the  meeting  may,  and  on  the  request  of  any  shareholder  or   a
shareholder's proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at  the  meeting.
The  number  of  inspectors  shall be either one  (l)  or  three  (3).   If
inspectors  are  appointed  at a meeting on the  request  of  one  or  more
shareholders  or  proxies, the holders of a majority  of  shares  or  their
proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (l) or three (3)
inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails
to  appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and
upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint
a person to fill that vacancy.

     These inspectors shall:

           (a)   Determine the number of shares outstanding and the  voting
power  of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence  of  a
quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

          (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;


                                       35
<PAGE>
          (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any  way
arising in connection with the right to vote;

          (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

          (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

          (f)  Determine the result; and

(g)   Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or  vote
with fairness to all shareholders.

and  place of such meetings are fixed by the Board of Directors or (2)  the
Regular  Annual Meeting is held at the principal place of business provided
at Section 1.1 hereof and on the date specified in Section 10.2 hereof.

Section  11.3:   Special  Meetings.   Special  meetings  of  the  Board  of
Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board,  if  any,
or  the President, or any Vice President, or the Secretary or by any two or
more directors.

      Section 11.4:  Notice of Special Meetings.  Special meetings  of  the
Board  of  Directors shall be held upon no less than four days'  notice  by
mail  or 48 hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph
to  each  director.  Notice need not be given to any director who  signs  a
waiver  of  notice  or  who attends the meeting without  protesting,  prior
thereto or at its commencement, the

                                       36

lack  of notice to such director.  Any oral notice given personally  or  by
telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at  the
home  or office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason
to  believe  will  promptly communicate it to the director.   A  notice  or
waiver  of notice need not specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board.
If the address of a director is not shown on the records and is not readily
ascertainable,  notice shall be addressed to him at the city  or  place  in
which the meetings of the directors are regularly held.  If the meeting  is
adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time
or  place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to  all
directors not present at the time of adjournment.

      Section  11.5:  Quorum.  A majority of all directors elected  by  the
shareholders  and appointed to fill vacancies as provided  in  Section  2.6
hereof  shall  constitute  a  quorum of the  Board  of  Directors  for  the
transaction of business.  Every act or decision done or made by a  majority
of  the  directors  present at a meeting duly held at  which  a  quorum  is
present is the act of the Board of Directors subject to provisions  of  law
relating  to  interested directors and indemnification of  agents  of  this
corporation.  A majority of the directors present, whether or not a  quorum
is  present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.  A  meeting
at  which  a quorum is initially present may continue to transact  business
notwithstanding  the  withdrawal  of directors,  if  any  action  taken  is
approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for such meeting.

      Section  11.6:   Conference  Telephone.   Members  of  the  Board  of
Directors  may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone
or similar communications equipment, so long as all directors participating
in  such meeting can hear one another.  Participation in a meeting pursuant
to this Section 11.6 constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

Section  11.7:   Waiver  of Notice and Consent.  The  transactions  of  any
meeting  of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or  wherever
held,  shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular
call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the
meeting,  each  of  the directors not present signs  a  written  waiver  of
notice,  a  consent to holding such meeting or an approval of  the  minutes
thereof.  All such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with  the
corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

      Section  11.8:   Action Without a Meeting.  Any  action  required  or
permitted by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without
a  meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors shall individually  or
collectively  consent in writing to such action.  Such written  consent  or
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of
Directors.  Such action by written consent shall have the  same  force  and
effect as the unanimous vote of such directors.

      Section  11.9:  Committees.  The provisions of this Article XI  apply
also to committees of the Board of Directors and action by such committees,
mutatis mutandis.

SUNDRY PROVISIONS

Section  12.1:   Instruments in Writing.  All checks, drafts,  demands  for
money  and  notes  of this corporation, and all written contracts  of  this
corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or  agents,
as  the  Board of Directors may from time to time designate.   No  officer,

corporation by contract or otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-
Laws or by the Board of Directors.

      Section  12.2:   Shares  Held by the Corporation.   Shares  in  other
corporations  standing  in the name of this corporation  may  be  voted  or

the  corporation by any officer of this corporation authorized so to do  by
resolution of the Board of Directors.

      Section 12.3:  Certificates of Stock.  There shall be issued to every
holder  of shares in this corporation a certificate or certificates  signed

and  by the Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer
or  the  Secretary  or any Assistant Secretary, certifying  the  number  of
shares and the class or series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any  or
all  of  the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  In  case  any
officer,  transfer  agent or registrar who has signed  or  whose  facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to  be  such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued,  it
may  be  issued by this corporation with the same effect as if such  person
were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

Section  12.4:  Lost Certificates.  Where the owner of any certificate  for
shares  of  this  corporation claims that the certificate  has  been  lost,
stolen  or  destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in  place  of  the
original  certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this  corporation
has  notice that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona  fide
purchaser, (2) files with this corporation an indemnity bond in  such  form
and in such amount as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the
President  or  a Vice President of this corporation, and (3) satisfies  any
other  reasonable requirements imposed by this corporation.  The  Board  of
Directors  may adopt such other provisions and restrictions with  reference
to  lost certificates, not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in
its discretion deem appropriate.

       Section  12.5:   Certification  and  Inspection  of  By-Laws.   This
corporation  shall keep at its principal executive or business  office  the
original  or  a  copy of these By-Laws as amended or otherwise  altered  to
date,  which  shall  be  open  to inspection by  the  shareholders  at  all
reasonable times during office hours.

      Section 12.6:  Annual Reports.  The making of annual reports  to  the

or  property  to,  or  guarantee the obligations of,  any  officer  of  the
corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer is  a
director, upon the approval of the Board of Directors alone.  Such approval
by the Board of Directors must be determined by a vote of a majority of the
disinterested directors, if it is determined that such a loan  or  guaranty
may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation.  In no event may  an
officer  owning  2%  or  more  of  the outstanding  common  shares  of  the
corporation be extended a loan under this provision.

REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS OF LAW

of  Law.   All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions
of  these  By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental

thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions
of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.

      Section  13.2:   By-Law Provisions Contrary to or  Inconsistent  with

effect,  but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability  of

Directors.  A By-Law adopted by the shareholders may restrict or  eliminate
the power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.

	Section  16.1:  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  The corporation
shall,  to  the  maximum extent and in the manner permitted  by  the  Code,

in  Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements,  and  other
amounts  actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding
(as  defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of the  fact

this Article XVI, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any
person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who
is  or  was  serving at the request of the corporation  as  a  director  or
officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or  other
enterprise,  or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation  which
was  a  predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise
at the request of such predecessor corporation.

	Section  16.2:  Indemnification of Others.  The corporation shall have  the
power,  to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Code, to indemnify
each  of  its  employees  and agents (other than  directors  and  officers)

fines,  settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred  in
connection with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the  Code),
arising  by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent  of  the
corporation.  For purposes of this Article XVI, an "employee" or "agent" of
the  corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any person (i)
who  is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or  was
serving  at  the  request of the corporation as an  employee  or  agent  of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
or  (iii)  who  was  an  employee or agent of a  corporation  which  was  a
predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at  the
request of such predecessor corporation.

      Section 16.3:  Payment of Expenses in Advance.  Expenses incurred  in
defending   any   civil  or  criminal  action  or  proceeding   for   which
indemnification  is  required  pursuant  to  Section  16.1  or  for   which
indemnification   is   permitted  pursuant  to   Section   16.2   following
authorization  thereof by the Board of Directors,  shall  be  paid  by  the
corporation  in  advance  of  the  final  disposition  of  such  action  or
proceeding  upon  receipt  of  an  undertaking  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that  the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized
in this Article XVI.

<PAGE>

      Section 16.4:  Indemnity Not Exclusive.  The indemnification provided
by  this  Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights  to
which  those  seeking  indemnification may be  entitled  under  any  bylaw,
agreement,  vote of shareholders or disinterested directors  or  otherwise,
both  as  to  action  in an official capacity and as to action  in  another
capacity  while  holding such office, to the extent  that  such  additional
rights to indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.

Section  16.5:  Insurance Indemnification.  The corporation shall have  the
power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is  or
was  an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against  or
incurred  by  such person in such capacity or arising out of such  person's
status  as  such, whether or not the corporation would have  the  power  to
indemnify  him against such liability under the provisions of this  Article
XVI.

     Section 16.6:  Conflicts.  No indemnification or advance shall be made
under  this  Article XVI, except where such indemnification or  advance  is
mandated  by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears:

           (a)   That  it  would be inconsistent with a  provision  of  the
Articles  of  Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders
or  an  agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause
of  the  action  asserted  in the proceeding in  which  the  expenses  were
incurred  or  other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise  limits
indemnification; or

           (b)   That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
